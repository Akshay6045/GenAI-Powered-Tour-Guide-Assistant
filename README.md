Prompt engineering involves designing and constructing specific, structured prompts or instructions for language models to guide their outputs towards desired responses or tasks. It's a technique used to control or steer the behavior of large language models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models by providing them with input prompts that influence the generated text.
Example of Prompt Engineering working model:
Input: The below screenshot demonstrates the input portion where we have to upload the files and  it will transform the data further to process it.
